/schedule/stops
List of all stops on all lines. 
Not currently very useful since we need to access stops on a specific line.

/schedule/stop_times
List of every specific time and stop.
The length of the array is over 85,000... don't really want to use that.
Use stop_times/<TRIP_ID> instead.

/schedule/trips
List of each trip/train for every day.
Can use in conjunction with calendar_dates to filter only todays running trains.
Also will need to filter through trip_id.

/schedule/shapes
I don't know what this is and it doesn't seem useful.

/schedule/routes
Array of each of the 12 Lines.
Could be useful to pull out either the color associated with the line or the long name of the line.

/schedule/calendar
List of all calendar codes.
Use calendar_dates instead.

/schedule/calendar_dates
List of calendar codes that are currently applicable.
Useful to filter through trips and only get those that are running today.

Has link to buy tickets.

Filter through the alerts based on line and display on main line page.

The location of trains could be put onto a map.
Other parts that wouldseem useful here don't actually seem to be utilized.

Very useful, not sure what /positions has that this one doesn't do better..
